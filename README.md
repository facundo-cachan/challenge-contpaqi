# Advanced Technical Challenge

## Goal

Develop an advanced web application using ReactJS that consumes data from a public API, styling the interface with Styled Components and Tailwind CSS. The application should implement advanced features such as (but not limited to):

- [x] TailwindCSS
- [x] Styled Components
- [x] Fetching strategy

1. [x] Global state management

3. [x] Optimization (performance, data loading, etc,)
4. [x] Unit testing and integration

The most important thing is to be able to see a clean, consistent architecture, with known patterns and architectures, ingenuity in applying it and with best practices.
Among the additional things you could add (which are highly favored) are:
1. [x] Including a page dedicated to key indicators (KPIs) with dynamic visualizations (dashboards)
2. [x] Caching Strategy

## Description
The challenge is to build a web application to manage and visualize information about movies using The Movie Database (TMDB) public API. The application must provide an efficient and fluid user experience, fulfilling the following technical requirements:

### Movie Search Functionality:
[x] Implement a search bar that allows users to search for movies by criteria such as title, genre, release year, or keywords.
[x] Use the TMDB API search endpoint (/search/movie) to retrieve results based on user queries.
[x] Display the results in a list that includes elements such as the movie title, a cover image, and a brief synopsis.
